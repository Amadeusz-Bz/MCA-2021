        <p>For Week's 10 task I have used jSymbolic notebook again to obtain similarity matrixes for 10 songs, as well as a visualisation of those tracks on 2D graph. 
Tracks 0-3 belong to classical genrewhile tracks 4-6 belong to rock genre and all of them were deafult tracks supplied with the task instructions. Tracks 7-9 are my personal tracks from 
          my dataset. They are the same tracks as last week, all coming from "Harry Potter and Philosopher's Stone" soundtrack. "Fluffy's Harp" is track 7, "Leaving Hogwarts" is track 8
and "Platform 9 and 3 quarters" is track 9. Unsurprisngly the matrix shows my tracks (track 7, 8, 9) being very similair to tracks 0-3. As the first four tracks belong to classical
genre, and my tracks are fully orchestral pieces made to accompany movie, and have a very classical identity to them, this similarity is not surprising. Track 4-6 are very different from my
          tracks, as the powerful, electric sound of rock has little in common with light, classical atmosphere of pieces 7 to 9.

      <h2>Transcription</h2>
      <p>I have used my MuseScore file from week 2, "Hedwig's Theme" from first Harry Potter movie, and have produced two sets of image files of its notation. First two picture are directly from MuseScore,
        the one I have been working on during Task 2 and 3, and the third image has been transcribed from Sonic Visualiser file.

        <br><br><p> The original images taken directly from manually edited MuseScore file are much cleaner, legible and coherent than polyphonic render. Another important difference is
      that the first file has three-eight time, while the polyphonic render has four-four time, which leads to a significant difference in each pieces speed and affects potential overall listening experience.
Even the number of bars appears to be wrong on the transcribed render, as it is much smaller than the first file, thus putting all the pitches and notational features very close together.
