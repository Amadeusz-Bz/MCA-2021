A theme that I have chosen for my datasets is the film score. I will be focusing on examining, analysing and editing pieces of music composed specifically for films. Given how popular many of the film scores are, data on them is usually easily and freely accessible. Of course it depends on a given movie's popularity, but by choosing appropriate scores I should be able to obtain all three needed types of data. On the example of Hedwig's Theme from the Harry Potter movie series, I was able to obtain:<br><br>
  
      <h2>1. Musical Score</h2>
      <p>I was able to find multiple files of notated data for film music, as its recreations and iterations are very popular. "Hediwg's Theme" being the most recognazible score from extremely popular Harry Potter movies has ample presence of notated data online, as exemplified in the image below with one such notation:

      </h2>2. Metadata</h2>
<p> Metadata for Hedwig's Theme is available from many sources describing the film, film's soundtrack or wider Harry Potter series' music. <br>
  Basic information includes John Williams, as composer, 2001 as a year of production, or the name of the Album which is  Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone Original Motion Picture.
  <h2>3. Audio data</h2> 
  <p>Audio recordings are freely available, even from the composer's official youtube account, which is a very accessible source:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtHra9tFISY">LINK to official audio rendition for "Hedwig's Theme".</a>


<p>Movie score is a very popular type of music that has attracted numerous instances of analysis, reproduction and debate. A lot of movie scores are actually considered of cultural significance and so they are curated and preserved by cultural heritage organisations. <br>Harry Potter score is very popular and recognizable, so it attracts attention from scholars, information professionals and general public alike, and thus has an abundance of information about it, as well as different iterations of its own data, available online.
