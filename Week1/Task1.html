      <h1> Inidividual Lab Activity week 1 </h1>
<p>A theme that I have chosen for my datasets is the Harry Potter film score. I will be focusing on examining, analysing and editing pieces of music composed specifically for Harry Potter films. Given how popular the franchise is, data on the songs is usually easily and freely accessible. By choosing appropriate scores I should be able to obtain all three needed types of data. On the example of Hedwig's Theme from the Harry Potter movie series, I was able to obtain:
      <h2>1. Musical Score</h2>
      <p>I was able to find multiple files of notated data for Harry Potter music, as its recreations and iterations are very popular. 
        "Hediwg's Theme" being the most recognazible score from extremely popular 
        An example is presented in the image below with one such notation:
      <img style="max-width:80%;max-height:80%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/baMsp2P.png"><br><br>
      <h2>2. Metadata</h2>
<p>Metadata for Hedwig's Theme is available from many sources describing the film, film's soundtrack or wider Harry Potter series' music. Basic information includes John Williams, as composer, 2001 as a year of production, or the name of the Album which is  Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone Original Motion Picture.
<h2>3. Audio recordings</h2> 
      Acoustic data is freely available, even from the composer's official youtube account, which is a very accessible source:

<p>Movie score is a very popular type of music that has attracted numerous instances of analysis, reproduction and debate. A lot of movie scores are actually considered of cultural significance and so they are curated and preserved by cultural heritage organisations. Harry Potter score is very popular and recognizable, so it attracts attention from scholars, information professionals and general public alike, and thus has an abundance of information about it, as well as different iterations of its own data, available online.
