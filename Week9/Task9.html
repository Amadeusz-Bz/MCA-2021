      <h1>Task 9: Analysing and Extracting Data from Audio</h1>
      <p> During week 9 I have worked in Sonic Visualiser and Jupyter Notebook to analyse 3 songs from my theme. I have chosen "Fluffy's Harp", "Leaving Hogwarts", and "Platform 9 and 3 quarters". 
All come from "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" movie soundtrack. Below are presented 3 panes from Sonic Visualiser for each song, showing my work with them, extracting spectrograms,
        Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chromagrams. <br><br>
        You can download the file HERE.

      <h2>Histograms Comparison</h2>
      <p>After working to extract features from songs through sonic visualiser into CSV files, I have uploaded these files into Jupyter notebook to obtain histograms
      from MFCC for all 20 features in all 3 songs. The MFCC histograms can be seen below:

      <img style="max-width:45%;max-height:45%;" src="https://github.com/Amadeusz-Bz/MCA-2021/blob/master/Week9/images/Platform_9_MFCC_Analysis_Histograms.png?raw=true">
          <figcaption> "Platform 9 and 3 quarters" MFCC Histograms for all 20 features. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> Comparing MFCC histograms for all 3 pieces I can definitely see that all 3 tracks are fairly similair. This makes sense as all 3 come from the soundtrack to the same film and,
for the most part, have similair, upbeat and orchestral motiffs. They are all instrumental, orchestral pieces and all want to signify magical, epic feeling within their respective scenes.
Out of all 3, histograms for "Platform 9 and 3 quarters" differ the most: they are the steepest and tallest on average which makes sense as this piece has the highest amount of 
          energetic chords that suddenly appear and quickly fade away, and has more shrill-sounding instruments than the other 2. As for MFCC histograms, which should help distinguish between timbres, the 
songs are really similair. This is due to the fact that all are orchestral pieces, recorded for one movie in (probably) one studio. This means that even though their instruments aren't
100% the same, they are largely similair between all 3 recordings.
