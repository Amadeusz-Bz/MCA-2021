      <h2>Metadata scheme </h2>
      <p> In my schema I have decided to include the following information:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Title:</b> Title of my encoded piece</li>
          <li><b>Composer:</b> Composer of the piece.</li>
          <li><b>Date Composed</b>: Date on which the piece was composed</li>
          <li><b>Album:</b> Where does the song originate from? Is it a part of a larger whole? This is especially relevant for movie soundtracks to signify which movie did they come from.</li>
          <li><b>Country Created:</b> Country from which the piece originated.</li>
          <li><b>Publisher:</b> Publisher of the song. Also very relevant for movie soundtracks as it's also usually the producer of the movie.</li>
          <li><b>Encoder:</b> Person that encoded the file.</li>
          <li><b>Encoding Date:</b> Date on which the file was encoded.</li>
          <li><b>Source:</b> Source of the original document which was used for transcription</li>
      </ul>
